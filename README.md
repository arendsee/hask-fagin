# A different approach

This folder contains a partially formed Haskell implementation of the Fagin
input data preparation program. The current approach of a mess of Bash, R, and
3rd-party programs is terribly bug-ridden. A port to Haskell would greatly
reduce this. I also have a good benchmark suite and can add tests.

However, it is not nearly ready to be added yet. Currently I have only a GFF
parser, and it is broken for mysterious reasons.
